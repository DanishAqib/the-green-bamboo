N.I.P Distilling,"Inspired by the city’s origin, N.I.P combines traditional botanicals of distilled gin with local flavours and aromas to create a unique Hong Kong spirit.  The main stage created by the traditional piney juniper berries is highlighted by the tangy aged tangerine peels, further complemented by the elegance and citrus of kumquat and the sweetness and lingering aromas of Shoumei tea.  This is a meticulously crafted gin that not only brings forth a complex yet balanced combination of flavours, but also the heritage and underlying attitude that is representative of Hong Kong.
