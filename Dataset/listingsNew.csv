The point behind these requests was that, for example, in order to sell a 3,000-yen lunch course at a restaurant, there is a need for a higher, 7,000-yen course menu. Therefore, in order to sell Dassai 23, the best way would be to craft a sake in a higher price range. Such requests were for us, unacceptable. Perhaps this was true, perhaps there was a need for an expensive Dassai. However, our motto at Asahi Shuzo is to not manipulate or inflame the market just to make profits. Indeed, it would be easy to put high price on a product, just by naming it differently or having a particular packaging. Still, we just could not.

Sake extracted by centrifugation has the “quality of sake without any unpleasantness”. It carries a refined gorgeousness and delicacy. On the other hand, when Dassai 23 mash is put into the centrifuge, the transparency of it alone seems too fine. Therefore, in order to give it a wider range of qualities present in alcoholic beverages, it was blended with sake pressed from the Yabuta. However, with the improvement of brewing techniques of Dassai artisans in recent years, it has become possible to create sake with a range of flavors while maintaining its transparency by controlling the fermentation process meticulously. The representative Dassai 23 Centrifuge now relies on the evolution of this technology and will no longer be blended, but instead use only Dassai 23 extracted via centrifugation resulting in final product that is pure yet has a refined transparency and delicacy at the same time.",,

The base flavour for this spirit comes from South Italian capers which are brought in directly from the cooperative. They’re distilled at 45 degrees to maintain the fresh iodic aroma. We combine this distillate with an infusion of Parmigiano-Reggiano, Italian parmesan cheese, which is glutamate-rich (the molecule which is responsible for our tongues ability to taste umami).  Combined with juniper, two other ingredients, and a base of neutral grain spirit, the blend is left to rest in an old cognac barrel for several months.

Currently operated by John Deward & Sons Ltd for Bacardi, the distillery was built in 1812 by Captain William Fraser of Brackla House. The whisky was selected by King Willian IV to be his whisky at the Royal Court, and in 1833, Brackla Distillery became the first whisky distillery to be granted a Royal Warrant by order of the King, subsequently renewed in 1838 by Queen Victoria. The distillery draws its water from Cawdor Burn, and does their fermentation for a total of over 70 hours. Tall stills designed to allow plenty of reflux are operated slowly in the distillation process to smooth the blend to maximise copper contact and produce a relatively light spirit.",,

The brewing method is called “bodaimoto,” developed by the monks in Bodaisen Shoyarku-ji, a temple in Nara Prefecture. It is considered to be the origin of all sake today, and the detailed process is described in Goshu no nikki, the first manual that documented sake-making procedures for private brewers, published in the early Muromachi era in Japan. The brewing method was very logical. It suggested to take in the lactic acid bacteria from the air for lactic acid fermentation in moromi and to suppress unwanted microorganisms so as to promote the propagation of the yeasts, derived from the brewing room. The effective use of lactic acid bacteria enabled the brewing to be completed in just about one week in summer or around in two weeks in winter.",,

We have succeeded in eliminating all off-flavors that in the past remained even in rice for daiginjo, and  realized an unprecedented gentle, mellow texture of remarkable delicacy, and a natural, elegant aroma. The level of flat rice polishing we attained was such that the grains became transparent. This even  surprised Mr Tomio Saito, the theorist of the flat rice polishing  method, and made him exclaim: “This is my ideal rice polishing!” Based on that success, we have stopped using the conventional rice polishing method and now only use the superflat rice polishing method for all our products. Daishichi Minowamon has won gold medals in both the ginjo and junmai sections at the Tohoku Sake Awards. Abroad, it has earned the highest praise from world level professionals at the Vinexpo, the largest alcoholic beverage fair in the world held in France, as well as from top-class restaurants in New York.",,

Instead of opting for the bottom-up way of product development where we would raise the polishing ratio of one of our products already on the market to produce a “middle level ginjo,” therefore a top-down approach was necessary: stepping down in style and quality to ginjo level from a top class existing product. Of course, during that process we gave its own individual character to Masakura and we took care to create a junmai ginjo with a high grade of perfection typical for Daishichi. The special circumstances of its origin are clear from the character of Daishichi Masakura. While basically being a ginjo, it has a richness and maturity typical for junmai made with the kimoto method, and there is a wide range of ways to drink it, from cold to warm. Also as regards food pairings, it is an almighty sake that fits to the whole meal, from delicate starters to the heavy main dish, and that since its release has been praised by many connoisseurs in various settings. What if you were allowed to bring only one bottle to a desert island? We recommend this sake.",,
